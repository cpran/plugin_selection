Description:
  Short: procedures to manage Praat selections
  Long: >
    This plugin defines a set of procedures to try to make it easier to manage
    the selection of objects in Praat. It is an attempt at providing some sort
    of informal API of sorts to save various selections, restore them at will,
    modify them, etc.

    Praat does not allow for the creation of custom object types, so it was
    necessary to generate some abstraction of a selection that could be
    represented using the existing object types. A **selection table** is a
    object of type `Table` that represents a given selection. The procedures
    provide ways to generate them based on the existing selection, to create
    new ones procedurally, and to make them either from subsets, or as
    combinations of existing tables.

    A **selection table** is simply a `Table` that contains the following
    fields:

    * `type`, holding the type of a given object as a string
    * `name`, holding the name of a given object as a string
    * `n`, a placeholder variable holding the value `1`
    * `id`, holding the id number of the corresponding object

    **Any** `Table` that contains _at least_ these columns will be considered
    a **selection table**, and can be used with these procedures.
