    - Broke down `selection.proc` into multiple smaller files which can be
      included separately:

      tiny.proc
        : Lightweight and anonymous selection handling, does not include
          any other files
      tables.proc
        : Contains all of the procedures using selection tables. Includes
          utils.proc.
      objects.proc
        : Contains all of the procedures using object tables. Includes
          tables.proc.
      selection.proc remains usable, and includes all of the above.
